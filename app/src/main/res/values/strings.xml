    <string name="welcome_message">East Africa\'s most cosmopolitan city, Nairobi is Kenyas beating  heart, an exciting, maddening concrete jungle that jarringly counterpoints the untrammelled natural beauty to be found elsewhere in the country</string>

    <string name="aboutA">Nairobi\'s polarising character ensures that the city is reviled and loved in equal measure, and even those who love it might well admit that it is  the kind of place many rave about only once they\'re away from it. For those who call it home, the city\'s charms include a vibrant cultural life, fabolous place to eat and exciting nightlife. Its detractors point to its horrendoud traffic, poor safety levels (\'Nairoberry\' is a common expat nickname) and its less-than - gorgeous appearance.</string>
    <string name="aboutB">However, with a fabolous national park on its doorstep, some wildlife-centric attractions, the excellent National Museum and a series of quirky sights, Nairobi\'s reality - like that of so many places with a bad reputation - will often come as a pleasant suprise</string>

    <string name="nairobi_history_body">Nairobi began in the late 1890s as a railway camp, where the British rested as they built the \'lunatic express\' - the Mombasa to Uganda railway line. It was originally named \'Ewaso NaiÂ´beri\', but the British had difficulty pronouncing this and, instead, coined their own name \'Nairobi\'. Because of its central location in Kenya, Nairobi later became the British provincial capital and, finally, the capital city of Kenya</string>
