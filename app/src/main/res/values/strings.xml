    <string name="welcome_message">East Africa\'s most cosmopolitan city, Nairobi is Kenyas beating  heart, an exciting, maddening concrete jungle that jarringly counterpoints the untrammelled natural beauty to be found elsewhere in the country</string>

    <string name="aboutA">Nairobi\'s polarising character ensures that the city is reviled and loved in equal measure, and even those who love it might well admit that it is  the kind of place many rave about only once they\'re away from it. For those who call it home, the city\'s charms include a vibrant cultural life, fabolous place to eat and exciting nightlife. Its detractors point to its horrendoud traffic, poor safety levels (\'Nairoberry\' is a common expat nickname) and its less-than - gorgeous appearance.</string>
    <string name="aboutB">However, with a fabolous national park on its doorstep, some wildlife-centric attractions, the excellent National Museum and a series of quirky sights, Nairobi\'s reality - like that of so many places with a bad reputation - will often come as a pleasant suprise</string>
